### [Description](#table-of-contents)
In this challenge, we where asked to create a Readme.md generator that we can use in future projects. In this challenge, I was able to to use node.js along with the inquirer, and fs packages to dynamically render the Readme.md based on the user's input. This will allow the user to spend less time creating a Readme, and more time developing their application. 



### [Installation](#table-of-contents)
The user should either download the zip file or clone the repository into a file using the terminal. After this step is completed, the user should open the file in VS code, or editor of their choosing. Open the terminal in the editor, and make sure you are in the root directory, (module9ReadMeGenerator) and start the application by typing "node index.js". (Make sure that Node, and NPM are installed on your machine.)



### [Usage](#table-of-contents)
After starting the application by typing "node index.js" into the terminal, the user will be prompted with questions related to their project. By using the inquirer package, we where able to get information about Title, Description, Installation, Usage, Contributions, Licensing, and Testing. I was also able to dynamically generate both a badge based upon what license was chosen, as well as icons based on what languages and frameworks where used. At the bottom there is a place where the user can be contacted with information about contributions, as well as questions.

### [Contributing](#table-of-contents)
I am currently not accepting contributions to this project.



### [Tests](#table-of-contents)
Testing can be completed by adding console.logs in the index.js file. To test these in the application, open the terminal in your editor while in the root directory, and type node index.js in the command line. Console.logs will appear in the terminal.
