### [Description](#table-of-contents)
In this challege we where asked to make a note taker app to record and store notes. We where asked to use express.js on the back end while saving and retreiving data from a JSON file. We also had the challenge of connecting the front and back end together. As a bonus this week we where also asked to create the delete button functionality, a skill we where not taught in class. 



### [Installation](#table-of-contents)
to install this, please either download the zip file from my github, or clone the repository. Once that step has been completed, you can either run the application in the browser, or from the terminal by typing "npm start".



### [Usage](#table-of-contents)
This application functions similarly to your notes app on your phone or mobile device. The app requires a title, as well as body to store the note. Notes can be saved by clicking on the save icon in the top right corner. You can add a new note by clicking on the plus button icon.  If you wish to delete a saved note, there is a trash button icon to the right of all saved notes that will delete any saved notes. Clicking the note taker button in the top left corner will take you back to the homepage. 



### [Contributing](#table-of-contents)
I am currently not accepting contributions to this project.



### [Tests](#table-of-contents)
You can test this application by adding your own user input. You can also add console logs to the server js to test the functionality of different features.
